I'm Zhu Jiarun, a Master student in Biomedical Data Science. I majored in Software Engineering as an undergraduate and had a good understanding of algorithms, programming and software development. Now, I am working on a project about doppelgänger effect which will cause models to perform well regardless of how they are trained due to high similarity of train and test data. And my aim is to understand the impact of doppelgänger effect on deep learning models.
