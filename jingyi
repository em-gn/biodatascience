I'm Hu Jingyi, a Master student in Biomedical Data Science. I majored in pharmaceutical sciences as an undergraduate, so I am relatively familiar with chemistry and biology. Now, my project is based on the Super Proliferation Set (SPS) to find and evaluate potential cancer treatment options, which will combine deep learning and pharmaceutical sciences, further give insight for practical applications.
