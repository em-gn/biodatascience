## Welcome to the BioData Science and Education Laboratory
We are a research group comprised of biodata scientists, computational biologists and education technologists in the School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University.

## Current projects
Our research activities may be broadly divided into two areas: biodata science and education technology.

[Biodata science](https://gohwils.github.io/biodatascience/biodatascience) is an exciting new area where the associative technologies associated with data science and relevant thinking skills are applied onto biological and health-related problems.

These may include how to resolve batch effect problems when effecting large-scale data mergers, improving study reproducibility, and understanding how choice of normalization method impacts downstream data modeling. We are also very interested in understanding how heterogeneity and data holes impacts outcome of analysis, especially in how it affects our interpretation of the underlying biological system.

Our interest in [Education technology (EdTech)](https://gohwils.github.io/biodatascience/edtech)  pertains to the use of data analytics for analyzing student performance and also the development of software for facilitating learning. In particular, we are interested in how we may leverage on big data and machine learning to unravel indicators of human-based deep learning. Instead of fielding our work on typical classroom-type settings, our interest is in combining EdTech with high-impact practices in teaching and learning, where deep learning is more likely to take place. Currently, we focus our research on NTU's unique [Deeper Experiential Engagement Project (DEEP)](https://gohwils.github.io/biodatascience/deep_programme), a large-scale pilot experiential learning project spread across different colleges.
