I am Tian Siqi, now a biomedical data science student at NTU. I have an interest in exploring the combination of machine learning techniques with biological applications. Now I am working on a project to evaluate the ability of SPS to generalize to other cancers and resolve random superiority signature issues in non-solid cancer diagnostics.
