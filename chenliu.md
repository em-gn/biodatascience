Cell programming and reprogramming are the basis for the formation of life individuals, and are of great value in the analysis of developmental mechanisms and the application of regenerative medicine. My research focuses on cell direct reprogramming / transdifferentiation based on machine learning methods. I work on applying AI algorithms (such as dynamic path planning, graph theory, graph neural network, etc.) to computational biology using bio-data (such as DNA/RNA sequence and bio-images), which helps to improve the efficiency and realize intelligent biology. Additionally, I am also fascinated about computer vision, image/video processing, and explainable machine learning. I am very interested in creating trustworthy, transparent and interpretable deep learning models.
